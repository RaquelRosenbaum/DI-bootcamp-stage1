    <h3> the 1970s, it was unheard of for a young girl to fly an airplane, but my Father was so far ahead of his time. He was determined to teach all the women in his life how to fly, how to drive a tractor, how to pull a trailer with a (standard transmission!) truck, how to make minor repairs or maintain a car, how to program a computer, many things to which most women had little or no exposure.</h3>  
    <br>
    <h3>So, when I was 13 years old, my Father taught me how to fly, and by 14 years old, I was flying by instrument flight rules (IFR). Our longest trip in his airplanes was round-trip from Los Angeles to Fairbanks, Alaska and back in a Cessna 185 like the one pictured above, and I did a lot of the flying and navigation during this and other trips. 
    <h3><i>It was an incredible experience!</i></h3>

    <h3>My father was an electronic engineer, and my first experience with programming was learning FORTRAN from him on his tape drive computer, when I was 12. Later on he sold Osborne computers, one of the first portable computers, and the first Apple Macintosh.

    <h3>As a result of this, I was one of the first high school kids to take notes in class with a computer. I used dbase II, SuperCalc, and Wordstar, and of course its operating system which we still use today on windows computers, the command prompt of MSDOS.</h3>  
    <br>
    <h3>An avid reader of software manuals, I was able to solve the problems that people had in learning how to accomplish things with these new tools. As a result, my first jobs in my early twenties were in software sales and database administration.</h3>

    <h3>When I first made Aliyah to Israel in 2004, I brought a Windows tower computer with me, but didn't realize that support for software problems is regional. Interactions with the internet frequently caused problems, but there was no help available, so I bought the four inch thick, "big book" on Windows published in hardback by Microsoft each year, read them cover to cover, and was able to solve the problems that I encountered. It was hard, but I learned a tremendous amount about operating systems and networks from this experience.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>The technological experiences in my young life, in addition to my mastery of technical graduate level courses in Geographic Information Systems, and many programming courses and certifications I've taken online in the years since, have all prepared me to play a significant role in intelligence analysis in the cyber age, here in Israel. Thank you so much, Dad, you made sure I grew up with technology and the skills important for success in life.</h3>
