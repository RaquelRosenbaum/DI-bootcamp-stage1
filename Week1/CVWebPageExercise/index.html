    <h3> In the 1970s, it was unheard of for a young girl to fly an airplane or program a computer, but my Father was so far ahead of his time. He was determined to teach all the women in his life how to fly, how to drive a tractor, how to pull a trailer with a (standard transmission!) truck, how to make minor repairs or maintain a car, how to program a computer, many things to which most women had little or no exposure.</h3>

    <h4><small>Tape Drive Computer Similar to What My Father Had in his Office (an example photo from the internet)</small></h4>
    </br>
    <h3>My father was an electronic engineer, and my first experience with programming was learning FORTRAN from him on his tape drive computer, when I was 12. Later on he was a retailer of Osborne computers, one of the first portable computers, and later he was one of the first retailers of the original Apple Macintosh (I'll bet he's wishing he kept a few around all these 40 years to sell now :-).

    <h4><small>Cessna 185 (an example photo from the internet, not the actual airplane)</small></h4>
    <h3>When I was 13 years old in 1978, my Father taught me how to fly, and by 14, I was flying by instrument flight rules (IFR). Our longest trip in his airplanes was round-trip from Los Angeles to Fairbanks, Alaska in a Cessna 185 like the one pictured above, and I did a lot of the flying and navigation during this and other trips. There was no tablet computer to use for nav, of course.  We had a huge duffel just for the 40 pounds of Jeppesen binders with all the ILS maps we'd need on our trip.</h3>
    <h3>The scenery from above Canada and Alaska was something out of this world, I didn't see anything of such a magnanimous scale again until I sailed the Northwest Passage.</h3>
    <h3><i>It was an incredible experience!</i></h3>

    <h4><small>What my Osborne Computer Looked Like - The End of the "Suitcase" Opened Out as a Keyboard (an example photo from the internet)</small></h4>
    <h3>I was one of the first high school kids to take notes in class with a computer (I used the Osborne, pictured above). I used dbase II, SuperCalc, and Wordstar, and of course its operating system which we still use today on windows computers, the command prompt of MSDOS.</h3>  
    <h3>An avid reader of software manuals, I was able to solve the problems that people had in learning how to accomplish things with these new tools. As a result, my first jobs in my early twenties were in software sales and database administration.</h3>

    <h4><small>What My Windows Tower Computer Looked Like (an example photo from the internet)</small></h4>
    <h3>When I first made Aliyah to Israel in 2004, I brought a Windows tower computer with me, but didn't realize that support for software problems is regional. Interactions with the internet frequently caused problems, but there was no help available because I wasn't in the region where I bought it, so I bought the four inch thick, "big book" on Windows, published in hardback by Microsoft each year.  I read them cover to cover, and was able to solve the problems that I encountered. It was tough, but I learned a tremendous amount about operating systems and networks from this experience!</h3>
    <hr>
    <h3>The technological experiences in my young life, in addition to my mastery of technical graduate level courses in Geographic Information Systems, and many programming courses and certifications I've taken online in the years since, have all prepared me to play a significant role in tech, here in Israel. Thank you so much, Dad, you made sure I grew up with technology and the skills important for success in life!</h3>

    Good boilerplates for CSS?<br>
    Need styling for font, word wrap, width and height, color, background color, etc.
    How to put the lines inside the table?
