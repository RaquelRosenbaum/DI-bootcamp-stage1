// Exercise 1 : List Of People

// Instructions
// const people = ["Greg", "Mary", "Devon", "James"];

const people = ["Greg", "Mary", "Devon", "James"];

// Part I - Review About Arrays
// Write code to remove “Greg” from the people array.

people.shift();
console.log(people);

// Write code to replace “James” with “Jason”.

people.splice(2,1,"Jason");
console.log(people);

// Write code to add your name to the end of the people array.

people.push("Raquel");
console.log(people);

// Write code that console.logs Mary’s index. take a look at the indexOf method on Google.

indMary = people.indexOf("Mary");
console.log(indMary);

// Write code to make a copy of the people array using the slice method.

shortenedPeople = people.slice(1,3);
console.log(shortenedPeople);

// The copy should NOT include “Mary” or your name.
// Hint: remember that now the people array should look like this const people = ["Mary", "Devon", "Jason", "Yourname"];
// Hint: Check out the documentation for the slice method

// Write code that gives the index of “Foo”. Why does it return -1 ?
// ********CAN'T FIND THIS*************
// console.log(people.indexOf([foo]));

// Create a variable called last which value is the last element of the array.
// ********CAN'T FIND THIS*************
let last = people[people.length+1];
console.log(last);
//  **************returns UNDEFINED on line 45*************

// Hint: What is the relationship between the index of the last element in the array and the length of the array?
    // It's the length of the array plus one

// Part II - Loops
// Using a loop, iterate through the people array and console.log each person.

// Using a loop, iterate through the people array and exit the loop after you console.log “Devon” .
// Hint: take a look at the break statement in the lesson.


// Exercise 2 : Your Favorite Colors
// Instructions
// Create an array called colors where the value is a list of your five favorite colors.
// Loop through the array and as you loop console.log a string like so: “My #1 choice is blue”, “My #2 choice is red” ect… .
// Bonus: Change it to console.log “My 1st choice”, “My 2nd choice”, “My 3rd choice”, picking the correct suffix for each number.
// Hint : create an array of suffixes to do the Bonus


// Exercise 3 : Repeat The Question
// Instructions
// Prompt the user for a number.
// Hint : Check the data type you receive from the prompt (ie. Use the typeof method)

// While the number is smaller than 10 continue asking the user for a new number.
// Tip : Which while loop is more relevant for this situation?


// Exercise 4 : Building Management
// Instructions:
// const building = {
//     numberOfFloors: 4,
//     numberOfAptByFloor: {
//         firstFloor: 3,
//         secondFloor: 4,
//         thirdFloor: 9,
//         fourthFloor: 2,
//     },
//     nameOfTenants: ["Sarah", "Dan", "David"],
//     numberOfRoomsAndRent:  {
//         sarah: [3, 990],
//         dan:  [4, 1000],
//         david: [1, 500],
//     },
// }


// Review About Objects
// Copy and paste the above object to your Javascript file.

// Console.log the number of floors in the building.

// Console.log how many apartments are on the floors 1 and 3.

// Console.log the name of the second tenant and the number of rooms he has in his apartment.

// Check if the sum of Sarah’s and David’s rent is bigger than Dan’s rent. If it is, than increase Dan’s rent to 1200.


// 🌟 Exercise 5 : Family
// Instructions
// Create an object called family with a few key value pairs.
// Using a for in loop, console.log the keys of the object.
// Using a for in loop, console.log the values of the object.


// Exercise 6 : Rudolf
// Instructions
// const details = {
//   my: 'name',
//   is: 'Rudolf',
//   the: 'raindeer'
// }
// Given the object above and using a for loop, console.log “my name is Rudolf the raindeer”


// Exercise 7 : Secret Group
// Instructions
// const names = ["Jack", "Philip", "Sarah", "Amanda", "Bernard", "Kyle"];
// A group of friends have decided to start a secret society. The society’s name will be the first letter of each of their names sorted in alphabetical order.
// Hint: a string is an array of letters
// Console.log the name of their secret society. The output should be “ABJKPS”
